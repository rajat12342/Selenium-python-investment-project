This program asks the user for a stock ticker, then analyzes whether the fundamental price ratios of that stock are within a certain range. If they are within a certain range, it tells the user that the company is profitable, if they are not, it tells the user the company is not profitable.  Furthermore, it asks the user to enter the percentage annual return they want from this company over the next 10 years or so, if they are to invest in it. The program then analyzes the free cash flows of the company and discounts them back using the desired annual return as the discount rate and outputs the price at which the stock needs to be bought to achieve the desired return.
